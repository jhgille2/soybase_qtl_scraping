#soybase 

# Overview
[[Projects/Mapping populations/soybase_qtl_scraping/sandbox/Soybase Meta Data.R|This is a script]] that I wrote back when I was working on my masters thesis (and the code is messy enough to make this obvious). It is designed to take in the name of some phenotype for which there is QTL data on soybase and return tables of meta-data about the QTL that have been identified for that phenotype.

I've re-written most of the functionality of the script into a [[R - Targets|targets]] workflow that (hopefully) makes using the script and manipulating the output data easier.
